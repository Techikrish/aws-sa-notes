# AWS CloudTrail

### **AWS CloudTrail Overview**

- **Definition**: AWS CloudTrail is a managed service that records API calls and events made by or on behalf of AWS accounts, providing detailed audit trails for security, compliance, and operational monitoring.
- **Key Features**:
    - Logs management events (e.g., IAM changes), data events (e.g., S3 object access), and Insights events (e.g., unusual API activity).
    - Stores logs in S3, integrates with CloudWatch Logs, SNS, EventBridge, and Athena for analysis.
    - Supports multi-account and multi-Region trails via AWS Organizations.
    - Provides tamper-proof logging with integrity validation and KMS encryption.
- **Use Cases**: Audit IAM role changes, investigate security incidents, ensure compliance (e.g., HIPAA), monitor resource usage.
- **Key Updates (2024–2025)**:
    - **Enhanced Insights Events**: Improved ML-based anomaly detection (October 2024).
    - **CloudTrail Lake Improvements**: Faster queries and cross-account data sharing (March 2024).
    - **FIPS 140-2 Compliance**: Enhanced for GovCloud (October 2024).
    - **Security Hub Integration**: Centralized audit findings (January 2025).

    - Delivers logs to S3 bucket, optionally to CloudWatch Logs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., trail logs all IAM API calls to S3.
- **Event**:
    - Record of an API call or resource activity, including who, what, when, where, and how.
    - Types: Management, Data, Insights.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., event for CreateBucket API call.

    - Logs control plane operations (e.g., IAM, EC2 instance creation).
    - Enabled by default for read/write events.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., log CreateRole API call.
- **Data Events**:
    - Logs data plane operations (e.g., S3 GetObject, Lambda Invoke).
    - Disabled by default, must be enabled.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., log S3 PutObject for audit.
- **Insights Events**:
    - Detects unusual API activity using ML (e.g., spike in DeleteBucket calls).
    - Optional, requires enablement.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., flag 100 CreateUser calls in an hour.
- **CloudTrail Lake**:
    - Managed data lake for querying and analyzing events without moving to S3.

    - Logs encrypted with SSE-S3 by default; optional KMS encryption.
    - API calls secured with HTTPS.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., use KMS key for sensitive logs.
- **Multi-Region Trails**:
    - Single trail captures events across all Regions.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., log EC2 events in us-east-1, us-west-2.
- **Organization Trails**:
    - Centralized logging for all accounts in AWS Organizations.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., log IAM changes for 10 accounts.
- **Event Selectors**:
    - Filter events to log (e.g., specific S3 buckets, Lambda functions).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., log only GetObject for my-bucket.
