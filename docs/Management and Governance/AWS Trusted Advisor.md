### **1. Trusted Advisor Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **Checks**:
    - Automated evaluations of AWS resources against best practices.
    - Organized into five categories:
        - **Cost Optimization**: Identifies unused/underutilized resources (e.g., idle EC2 instances, unattached EBS volumes).
        - **Security**: Detects vulnerabilities (e.g., open S3 buckets, disabled MFA).
        - **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures resilience (e.g., Auto Scaling groups, Multi-AZ RDS).
        - **Performance**: Optimizes resource efficiency (e.g., high-utilization EC2, oversized RDS instances).
        - **Service Limits**: Monitors quota usage (e.g., VPCs, IAM roles).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Security check flags public S3 bucket.
- **Recommendations**:
    - Actionable suggestions to address check findings.
    - Severity: **Red** (urgent), **Yellow** (action recommended), **Green** (no issues).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., recommendation to delete unused EBS volume (Cost Optimization, Yellow).
- **Dashboard**:
    - Console interface to view check statuses, recommendations, and trends.
    - Filters by category, severity, or resource.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., dashboard shows 5 red security checks.
- **Notifications**:
    - Alerts via CloudWatch Events, SNS, or email for new/updated recommendations.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., SNS notification for red security check.
