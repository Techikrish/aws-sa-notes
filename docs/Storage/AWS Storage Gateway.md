# AWS Storage Gateway

### **AWS Storage Gateway Overview**

- **Definition**: AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments to AWS cloud storage, providing seamless integration via standard storage protocols (NFS, SMB, iSCSI, iSCSI-VTL) with local caching for low-latency access.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports four gateway types: S3 File Gateway, FSx File Gateway (legacy for existing customers), Volume Gateway, and Tape Gateway.
    - Integrates with AWS services (S3, Glacier, EBS, FSx for Windows File Server, AWS Backup, CloudWatch, IAM, KMS).
    - Deployable as a virtual machine (VM), hardware appliance, or EC2 instance.
    - Provides secure data transfer (SSL) and encryption at rest (S3-SSE or KMS).
- **Use Cases**: Backups to the cloud, cloud-backed file shares, low-latency access for on-premises apps, data lake workflows, disaster recovery (DR).
- **Key Update (2024)**: Amazon FSx File Gateway is no longer available to new customers; existing users can continue, but S3 File Gateway or FSx for Windows File Server is recommended for similar functionality.

        - Files stored as native S3 objects with POSIX metadata (ownership, permissions, timestamps).
        - Supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and S3 Object Lock (WORM).
        - Local cache (up to 64 TB) for low-latency access.
    - **Use Cases**: Data lakes, backups (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle), ML workflows, archiving media.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., mount S3 bucket as NFS share for database dumps.
