# AWS PrivateLink

### **AWS PrivateLink Overview**

- **Definition**: AWS PrivateLink is a service that enables secure, private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications over the AWS network, without exposing traffic to the public internet. It uses interface VPC endpoints and endpoint services powered by Network Load Balancer (NLB).
- **Key Features**:
    - Provides private access to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) and customer/partner services via VPC endpoints.
    - Supports cross-account, cross-Region, and hybrid connectivity.
    - Integrates with VPC, NLB, Route 53, IAM, CloudWatch, and AWS Direct Connect/Site-to-Site VPN.
    - Ensures traffic remains within the AWS network, enhancing security and reducing latency.
- **Use Cases**: Secure access to SaaS applications, shared services across accounts, private API access, hybrid cloud connectivity, compliance-driven private networking.
- **Key Updates (2024–2025)**:
    - **Enhanced VPC Endpoint Policies**: Fine-grained access control for AWS services (October 2024).
    - **PrivateLink for On-Premises**: Simplified hybrid access via Direct Connect/VPN (March 2024).
    - **NLB Integration Improvements**: Support for PrivateLink endpoint services with static IPs (January 2025).
    - **FIPS 140-2 Compliance**: Available for PrivateLink endpoints in AWS GovCloud (October 2024).

### **1. PrivateLink Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **VPC Endpoint**:
    - An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in a subnet that provides private access to AWS services or endpoint services.
    - Types:
        - **Interface Endpoint**: Uses ENI with private IP for AWS services (e.g., ECS, Lambda) or customer/partner services.
        - **Gateway Endpoint**: Route table entry for S3 and DynamoDB (no ENI, no PrivateLink charges).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., interface endpoint for ECS in us-east-1 VPC.
- **Endpoint Service**:
    - A service hosted by a provider (AWS, customer, or partner) accessible via PrivateLink.
    - Powered by NLB (internal) to distribute traffic to backend resources (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., customer API hosted behind NLB accessed via endpoint service.
- **Service Consumer**:
    - VPC or on-premises environment that connects to an endpoint service or AWS service via a VPC endpoint.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., consumer VPC accesses SaaS app via interface endpoint.
- **Service Provider**:
    - AWS account or partner hosting the endpoint service.
    - Configures allowed principals (AWS accounts, IAM roles) for access.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., provider account hosts API endpoint service.
- **DNS Resolution**:
    - PrivateLink endpoints use private DNS names (e.g., vpce-123.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com).
    - Route 53 private hosted zones or DNS overrides resolve to endpoint private IPs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., resolve s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com to VPC endpoint IP.

### **Networking Concepts**

- **Private Connectivity**:
    - Traffic stays within AWS network, avoiding internet gateways, NAT gateways, or public IPs.
    - Uses ENI private IPs for interface endpoints, route table entries for gateway endpoints.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., EC2 accesses S3 via gateway endpoint without internet.
- **Cross-Account Access**:
    - Endpoint service allows specific AWS accounts or IAM principals to create endpoints.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Account A accesses Account B’s API via PrivateLink.
- **Cross-Region Access**:
    - Consumers in one Region access endpoint services in another via VPC peering, Transit Gateway, or Direct Connect.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., us-west-2 VPC accesses us-east-1 endpoint service.
- **On-Premises Access**:
    - Connect to endpoint services via Direct Connect or Site-to-Site VPN.
    - Requires private DNS resolution (e.g., on-premises DNS server).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., on-premises app accesses AWS API via PrivateLink over Direct Connect.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand interface vs. gateway endpoints, endpoint services, and hybrid access.
- **Mastery Tip**: Compare PrivateLink vs. VPC peering vs. public APIs for secure connectivity.
