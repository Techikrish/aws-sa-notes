### **1. VPC Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **VPC**:
    - A logically isolated network with a private CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
    - Regional scope, spans multiple AZs, supports IPv4 and IPv6.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., VPC in us-east-1 with CIDR 172.31.0.0/16.
- **Subnet**:
    - A segment of the VPC’s CIDR block, tied to a single AZ.
    - Types:
        - **Public Subnet**: Routes to an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public access.
        - **Private Subnet**: No direct internet access, uses NAT for outbound traffic.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., public subnet 172.31.1.0/24 in us-east-1a, private subnet 172.31.2.0/24 in us-east-1b.
- **Route Table**:
    - Defines rules for routing traffic within the VPC and to external networks.
    - Each subnet is associated with one route table.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., route 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW for public subnet.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
    - Enables internet access for public subnets.
    - Attached to the VPC, highly available.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., IGW allows EC2 in public subnet to access internet.
- **NAT Gateway/NAT Instance**:
    - Enables private subnets to access the internet (outbound) without exposing them to inbound traffic.
    - NAT Gateway: Managed, scalable; NAT Instance: EC2-based, customizable.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., NAT Gateway in public subnet for private EC2 outbound traffic.
- **Security Group**:
    - Stateful firewall at the resource level (e.g., EC2, RDS).
    - Controls inbound/outbound traffic based on rules (e.g., allow port 80).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., security group allows SSH (port 22) from 203.0.113.0/24.
- **Network ACL (NACL)**:
    - Stateless firewall at the subnet level.
    - Controls traffic with numbered rules, applied to all resources in the subnet.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., NACL allows HTTP (port 80) to subnet, denies FTP.
- **VPC Endpoint**:
    - Provides private access to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) without internet.
    - Types:
        - **Gateway Endpoint**: Free, for S3 and DynamoDB (route table entry).
        - **Interface Endpoint**: Uses ENI for other services (e.g., ECS, powered by PrivateLink).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., gateway endpoint for S3 in private subnet.

### **Networking Concepts**

- **CIDR Block**:
    - Defines the IP address range for the VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16, up to /16 max).
    - Supports secondary CIDRs and IPv6 (AWS-assigned or BYOIP).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., primary CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, secondary 10.1.0.0/16.
- **IPv6**:
    - Supports dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) or IPv6-only VPCs.
    - AWS provides /56 CIDR, subnets use /64.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., IPv6 subnet 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64.
- **VPC Peering**:
    - Connects two VPCs (same or different accounts/Regions) for private communication.
    - Non-transitive, requires route table updates.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., peer VPC A (10.0.0.0/16) to VPC B (172.31.0.0/16).
- **Transit Gateway**:
    - Centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect.
    - Replaces complex VPC peering meshes.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Transit Gateway connects 10 VPCs to on-premises VPN.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, NACLs, and endpoints.
- **Mastery Tip**: Compare VPC vs. Transit Gateway vs. VPC peering for connectivity.
