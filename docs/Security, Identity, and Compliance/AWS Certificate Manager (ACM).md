### **1. ACM Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **Public Certificate**:
    - Free SSL/TLS certificate issued by ACM for public domains.
    - Managed by ACM (cannot export private key).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., certificate for www.example.com on CloudFront.
- **Private Certificate**:
    - Issued by ACM Private CA for internal resources (e.g., intranet servers).
    - Exportable private key for non-AWS use.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., certificate for internal API server.
- **ACM Private Certificate Authority (CA)**:
    - Managed private CA for issuing and managing private certificates.
    - Supports root and subordinate CAs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., root CA for issuing employee VPN certificates.
- **Certificate Validation**:
    - **DNS Validation**: Preferred, uses CNAME record (automated with Route 53).
    - **Email Validation**: Sends approval email to domain contacts.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., add CNAME in Route 53 for example.com validation.
- **Certificate Renewal**:
    - ACM automatically renews public and private certificates before expiry.
    - Requires DNS/email validation to remain active.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., auto-renew certificate 60 days before expiry.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Domain Coverage**:
    - Supports single-domain, wildcard (*.example.com), and multi-domain (SAN) certificates.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., wildcard certificate for *.example.com and example.com.
- **Certificate Deployment**:
    - Automatically deployed to integrated AWS services (e.g., ALB, CloudFront).
    - Manual deployment for private certificates outside AWS.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., attach certificate to ALB listener.
- **Certificate Import**:
    - Import third-party certificates into ACM for AWS service use.
    - Requires certificate, private key, and chain.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., import DigiCert certificate for API Gateway.
- **Tagging**:
    - Apply tags to certificates for organization and cost tracking.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., tag certificate with “Project:WebApp”.
- **Revocation**:
    - Private CA supports certificate revocation via CRL (Certificate Revocation List).
    - Public certificates cannot be revoked (rely on CA).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., revoke compromised private certificate.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand public vs. private certificates, validation, renewal, and integrations.

### **5. ACM Cost Optimization**

Cost efficiency is a key exam domain.

### **Pricing**

- **Public Certificates**:
    - Free for ACM-managed certificates used with AWS services.
    - **Example**: 10 public certificates for ALB = $0/month.
- **Private CA**:
    - $400/month per CA (prorated, minimum 1 month).
    - $0.75/private certificate issued.
    - **Example**: 1 CA, 100 certificates = $400 + (100 × $0.75) = $475/month.
- **Imported Certificates**:
    - Free, but manual renewal increases operational cost.
    - **Example**: Import 5 third-party certificates = $0/month.
- **KMS**:
    - $1.00/CMK/month, $0.03/10,000 requests (AWS-managed key free).
    - **Example**: 1 CMK for Private CA = $1/month.
- **Total Example**:
    - 10 public certificates, 1 Private CA, 100 private certificates, 1 CMK:
        - Public: $0.
        - Private CA: $400.
        - Private Certificates: 100 × $0.75 = $75.
        - KMS: $1.
        - Total: $476/month.

### **Cost Strategies**

- **Use Public Certificates**:
    - Free for AWS-integrated services; avoid third-party certificates.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., use ACM public certificate to save $100/year vs. third-party.
