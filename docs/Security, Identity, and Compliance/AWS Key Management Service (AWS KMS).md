### **1. KMS Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **KMS Key**:
    - A cryptographic key (symmetric or asymmetric) used for encryption/decryption or signing/verification.
    - Stored in AWS-managed hardware security modules (HSMs).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., symmetric key for S3 bucket encryption.
- **Key Types**:
    - **Symmetric**: Single key for encryption/decryption (AES-256, default).
    - **Asymmetric**: Key pair for encryption/signing (RSA, ECC).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., asymmetric RSA key for client-side encryption.
- **Key Policy**:
    - JSON document defining who can use or manage the key (e.g., kms:Encrypt, kms:CreateGrant).
    - Default policy grants access to account root.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., policy allows Lambda role to use key.
- **Customer Managed Key (CMK)**:
    - Keys created and managed by you, with customizable policies and rotation.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., CMK for RDS encryption.
- **AWS Managed Key**:
    - Keys created and managed by AWS for specific services (e.g., aws/s3).
    - No rotation control, limited policy customization.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., AWS managed key for default S3 encryption.
- **Key Rotation**:
    - Automatically rotates symmetric CMKs annually, retaining old versions.
    - Asymmetric keys and AWS managed keys require manual rotation.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., rotate CMK every 365 days for compliance.
- **Grants**:
    - Fine-grained permissions for specific key operations without modifying key policy.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., grant kms:Decrypt to EC2 instance.

### **Key Concepts**

    - Uses a data key (encrypted by KMS key) to encrypt data, reducing KMS calls.
    - Data key stored alongside encrypted data.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., S3 uses envelope encryption for object data.
- **Key Material**:
    - Cryptographic material for keys, either AWS-generated or customer-imported.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., import key material for hybrid cloud.
- **Multi-Region Keys**:
    - Replicate CMKs across Regions for low-latency and DR.
    - Same key ID, material, and policy across Regions (new 2024).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., replicate key from us-east-1 to eu-west-1.
