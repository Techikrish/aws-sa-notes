# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview**

- **Definition**: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It provides fine-grained control over who can do what, using identities, policies, and roles.
- **Key Features**:
    - Manages users, groups, roles, and policies for access control.
    - Supports identity federation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    - Integrates with AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda) and external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SAML, OIDC).
    - Offers monitoring via CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer for security insights.
- **Use Cases**: Secure application access, manage hybrid cloud permissions, enforce least privilege, comply with regulations, automate access for serverless apps.
- **Key Updates (2024–2025)**:
    - **Enhanced ABAC**: Simplified tag-based policies with new conditions (October 2024).
    - **IAM Access Analyzer Improvements**: Cross-account trust analysis and unused permission detection (March 2024).
    - **MFA Enhancements**: Passwordless MFA with passkeys (January 2025).
    - **FIPS 140-2 Compliance**: Enhanced for IAM in AWS GovCloud (October 2024).

### **1. IAM Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **IAM User**:
    - An identity representing a person or application with AWS credentials (access key, password).
    - Best for long-term access (e.g., admin, developer).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., IAM user “alice” with console access to S3.
- **IAM Group**:
    - A collection of IAM users for easier policy management.
    - Policies applied to groups affect all members.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., “Developers” group with EC2 read permissions.
- **IAM Role**:
    - An identity with temporary credentials for AWS services, applications, or federated users.
    - Assumed via STS (Security Token Service) for short-term access.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., EC2 role for S3 access, Lambda execution role.
- **IAM Policy**:
    - JSON document defining permissions (allow/deny) for actions, resources, and conditions.
    - Types:
        - **Managed Policies**: AWS-managed or customer-managed, reusable.
        - **Inline Policies**: Embedded in user/group/role, non-reusable.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., policy allows s3:GetObject on my-bucket.
- **Access Key**:
    - Programmatic credentials (access key ID, secret access key) for CLI/API access.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., access key for CI/CD pipeline to S3.
- **MFA**:
    - Adds a second authentication factor (e.g., virtual MFA, hardware, passkeys).
    - Required for sensitive actions (e.g., root user, IAM changes).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., virtual MFA on admin user.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Principle of Least Privilege**:
    - Grant only the permissions needed to perform a task.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Lambda role with dynamodb:GetItem only.
- **Policy Evaluation**:
    - AWS evaluates all applicable policies (identity-based, resource-based, SCPs) to determine access.
    - Deny overrides Allow; explicit Allow required.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., deny in SCP blocks S3 access despite role Allow.
- **Identity Federation**:
    - Allows external identities (e.g., AD, Google) to access AWS via SAML, OIDC, or Web Identity.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., SAML federation with Active Directory for SSO.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
    - Uses tags to control access dynamically (e.g., Project:Finance).
    - Enhanced conditions for tags (new 2024).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., allow S3 access if ResourceTag/Environment=Prod.
- **Security Token Service (STS)**:
    - Issues temporary credentials for roles or federated users.
    - Supports AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., EC2 assumes role for temporary S3 access.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand users, groups, roles, policies, MFA, and ABAC.
- **Mastery Tip**: Compare IAM roles vs. users vs. resource-based policies for access control.
