# AWS Lambda

### **AWS Lambda Overview**

- **Definition**: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes code in response to events and automatically scales, charging only for the compute time used.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports multiple languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java, Go, .NET).
    - Triggered by events from AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway) or custom sources.
    - Scales automatically, handles millions of requests, and supports concurrency controls.
    - Integrates with VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, and other AWS services for networking, security, and monitoring.
    - Offers features like provisioned concurrency, response streaming, and function URLs.
- **Use Cases**: Web APIs, data processing, real-time file processing, automation, microservices, event-driven applications.
- **Key Updates (2024–2025)**:
    - **Response Streaming**: Enables streaming responses for large payloads (October 2024).
    - **Enhanced Observability**: Improved CloudWatch metrics and Lambda Insights (March 2024).
    - **Function URLs**: Simplified HTTP endpoints without API Gateway (January 2025).
    - **FIPS 140-2 Compliance**: Available for Lambda in AWS GovCloud (October 2024).

### **1. Lambda Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **Function**:
    - The executable code deployed to Lambda, written in a supported runtime (e.g., Python 3.12).
    - Includes handler (entry point), configuration (memory, timeout), and dependencies.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Python function triggered by S3 to process uploaded files.
- **Event Source**:
    - AWS service or custom application that triggers the function.
    - Types:
        - **Push**: Services (e.g., S3, SNS) send events to Lambda.
        - **Pull**: Lambda polls streams (e.g., Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., API Gateway pushes HTTP requests to Lambda.
- **Trigger**:
    - Configured mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., S3 bucket event triggers function on file upload.
- **Execution Environment**:
    - Isolated runtime environment (micro-VM) for function execution.
    - Includes memory (128 MB–10,240 MB), ephemeral storage (/tmp, up to 10 GB), and runtime.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., 512 MB function with 1 GB /tmp for file processing.
- **Concurrency**:
    - Number of function instances running simultaneously.
    - **Reserved Concurrency**: Limits function concurrency.
    - **Provisioned Concurrency**: Pre-warms instances for low latency.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., set 100 reserved concurrency for API function.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
    - Functions respond to events (e.g., HTTP request, S3 upload, SNS message).
    - Asynchronous (e.g., S3) or synchronous (e.g., API Gateway) invocation.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Lambda processes DynamoDB stream updates.
- **Timeout and Memory**:
    - Timeout: Max execution time (1 second–15 minutes, default 3 seconds).
    - Memory: Controls CPU and performance (128 MB–10,240 MB).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., 5-minute timeout for data processing function.
- **Layers**:
    - Reusable code or dependencies (e.g., libraries, runtimes) shared across functions.
    - Up to 5 layers per function, max 250 MB unzipped.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., layer with pandas library for Python functions.
- **Function URLs**:
    - Built-in HTTPS endpoints for invoking functions without API Gateway.
    - Supports IAM or public access (new 2025).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., function URL for simple web API.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand functions, triggers, concurrency, and event sources.

    - **Asynchronous**: Lambda retries twice, then sends to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
    - **Stream-based**: Retries until success or expiry (e.g., Kinesis).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., async S3 event retries twice, then sent to SQS DLQ.
- **Exam Tip**: Configure DLQ for async failures.

### **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:

- **Purpose**: Capture failed events.
- **Features**:
    - Sends unprocessed async events to SQS or SNS.
    - Configurable per function.
- **Explanation**: E.g., failed DynamoDB stream event sent to SQS for analysis.

### **Multi-AZ Execution**:

- **Purpose**: Survive AZ failures.
- **Features**:
    - Lambda runs in multiple AZs by default, no configuration needed.
    - Integrates with multi-AZ services (e.g., ELB, RDS).
- **Explanation**: E.g., Lambda processes S3 events even if us-east-1a fails.
- **Exam Tip**: Highlight default HA for Lambda.

### **Monitoring and Failover**:

- **Purpose**: Detect and respond to issues.
- **Features**:
    - CloudWatch metrics: Invocations, Errors, Duration, Throttles.
    - Lambda Insights: Enhanced observability (CPU, memory, network) (new 2024).
    - Alarms for high error rates or throttling.
- **Explanation**: E.g., alarm if ErrorCount > 10 for 5 minutes.
- **Exam Tip**: Use CloudWatch and Insights for monitoring.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Resilience**: Retries + DLQ + multi-AZ + CloudWatch = reliable serverless.
- **Exam Tip**: Design resilient apps with DLQ and multi-AZ triggers.

    - HTTPS for API Gateway, function URLs, and AWS service triggers.
    - VPC traffic uses TLS (e.g., Lambda to RDS).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., HTTPS endpoint for function URL.
- **At Rest**:
    - Code and environment variables encrypted with KMS.
    - Ephemeral storage (/tmp) encrypted by default.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., KMS key for sensitive environment variables.
- **Exam Tip**: Use KMS for sensitive data in Lambda.

### **VPC Integration**

- **Features**:
    - Deploy Lambda in VPC to access private resources (e.g., RDS, ElastiCache).
    - Requires subnets, security groups, and ENI allocation.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Lambda in private subnet accesses RDS.
- **Exam Tip**: Configure VPC for private resource access.

### **Compliance**

- **Certifications**: HIPAA, PCI, SOC, ISO, GDPR, FIPS 140-2 (GovCloud).

### **5. Lambda Cost Optimization**

Cost efficiency is a key exam domain.

### **Pricing**

- **Compute**:
    - $0.00001667/GB-second (us-east-1).
    - Billed for duration and memory (e.g., 512 MB function for 1 second = 0.5 GB-second).
- **Requests**:
    - $0.20/million requests.
- **Ephemeral Storage**:
    - $0.0000000309/GB-second (above 512 MB, up to 10 GB).
- **Provisioned Concurrency**:
    - $0.000004167/GB-second (higher than regular compute).
- **Example**:
    - 1 million invocations, 512 MB, 1-second duration:
        - Requests: 1M × $0.20/1M = $0.20.
        - Compute: 1M × 0.5 GB × 1s × $0.00001667 = $8.335.
        - Total: $8.535/month.
    - Add 100 provisioned concurrency: 100 × 0.5 GB × 24 × 30 × 3600 × $0.000004167 = $1,800/month.
- **Free Tier**:
    - 1 million requests/month, 400,000 GB-seconds/month.

### **Cost Strategies**

- **Optimize Memory and Timeout**:
    - Use minimal memory for workload (e.g., 128 MB for lightweight tasks).
    - Set appropriate timeout to avoid overrunning.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., reduce from 512 MB to 256 MB for simple API.
- **Avoid Provisioned Concurrency**:
    - Use only for latency-sensitive apps to avoid high costs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., skip provisioned concurrency for batch processing.
- **Minimize Requests**:
    - Batch events (e.g., S3 batch operations) to reduce invocations.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., process 100 S3 files in one invocation.
- **Use Ephemeral Storage Efficiently**:
    - Keep /tmp usage under 512 MB to avoid extra charges.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., stream data to S3 instead of /tmp.
- **Tagging**:
    - Use cost allocation tags to track Lambda costs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., tag function with “Project:API”.
- **Monitor Usage**:
    - Use CloudWatch to optimize duration and memory allocation.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., reduce memory if Duration is low.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Cost Savings**: Minimal memory + no provisioned concurrency + batching = lower costs.
- **Exam Tip**: Calculate costs for compute, requests, and provisioned concurrency.
