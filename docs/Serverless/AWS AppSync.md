### **1. AppSync Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **GraphQL API**:
    - A managed GraphQL endpoint that handles queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
    - Defined by a schema (SDL format) and resolvers.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., AppSync API for a social media app with user and post types.
- **Schema**:
    - Defines the GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions (written in Schema Definition Language, SDL).
    - Specifies the data structure and operations clients can perform.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., schema with type User { id: ID!, name: String }.
- **Resolver**:
    - Maps GraphQL fields to data sources (e.g., DynamoDB, Lambda).
    - Uses request/response mapping templates (VTL or JavaScript, new 2024).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., resolver maps getUser query to DynamoDB table.
- **Data Source**:
    - Backend service that AppSync queries (e.g., DynamoDB, Lambda, RDS, HTTP, OpenSearch).
    - Configured with IAM roles for access.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., DynamoDB table as data source for user data.
- **Subscription**:
    - Real-time updates for clients via WebSocket (GraphQL subscriptions).
    - Triggered by mutations (e.g., onCreatePost).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., subscribe to new posts in a chat app.
- **Pipeline Resolver**:
    - Chains multiple resolvers for complex logic (e.g., fetch data, transform, store).
    - Supports functions for reusable logic.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., pipeline resolver validates input, then saves to DynamoDB.

### **Key Concepts**

- **GraphQL Operations**:
    - **Query**: Fetch data (e.g., getUser(id: "123")).
    - **Mutation**: Modify data (e.g., createPost(title: "Hello")).
    - **Subscription**: Real-time updates (e.g., onCreatePost).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., query fetches user, mutation creates post, subscription notifies new posts.
- **Caching**:
    - In-memory caching at API level to reduce latency and data source calls.
    - Configurable TTL (time-to-live) per query.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., cache getUser results for 60 seconds.
- **Authorization**:
    - Supports IAM, Amazon Cognito, API keys, and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
    - Fine-grained access control at field level.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Cognito restricts getUser to authenticated users.
- **Real-Time**:
    - Subscriptions use WebSocket for low-latency updates.
    - Enhanced WebSocket management (new 2025).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., real-time chat updates via subscriptions.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand GraphQL APIs, schemas, resolvers, data sources, and subscriptions.
