    - Offers ECS and EKS orchestration, supports Windows and Linux containers.
    - Provides enhanced observability and Graviton-based compute options.
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, batch processing, web applications, CI/CD pipelines, machine learning workloads.
- **Key Updates (2024–2025)**:
    - **Enhanced Observability**: Improved CloudWatch Container Insights metrics (October 2024).
    - **Graviton Processor Support**: Arm-based Graviton3 for cost/performance (March 2024).

### **1. Fargate Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **Fargate Task**:
    - A running instance of a containerized application defined by a task definition.
    - Specifies container image, CPU/memory, networking, and IAM roles.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Fargate task runs a Node.js app container with 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB memory.
- **Task Definition**:
    - JSON configuration for a task, including container images, ports, environment variables, and resource limits.
    - Supports multiple containers per task (sidecars, e.g., logging).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., task definition for web app and Prometheus sidecar.
- **Service**:
    - Manages long-running tasks in ECS, ensuring desired task count and load balancing.
    - Integrates with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., ECS service runs 5 Fargate tasks behind ALB.
- **Cluster**:
    - Logical grouping of tasks/services in ECS or EKS.
    - Fargate manages compute, no EC2 instances in cluster.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., ECS cluster for microservices app.
- **Fargate Launch Type**:
    - Serverless compute mode for ECS/EKS (vs. EC2 launch type).
    - Fully managed, no server provisioning.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Fargate launch type for ECS web app.

### **Networking Concepts**

- **VPC Integration**:
    - Tasks run in VPC subnets with security groups for network control.
    - Supports public/private subnets, Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Fargate task in private subnet accesses RDS.
- **Task Networking Modes**:
    - **awsvpc**: Default for Fargate, each task gets its own ENI and private IP.
    - Enables fine-grained security group rules.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., awsvpc mode assigns 10.0.1.10 to task.
- **Load Balancing**:
    - Integrates with ALB/NLB for distributing traffic to tasks.
    - Supports dynamic port mapping for multiple containers.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., ALB routes HTTP traffic to Fargate tasks.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand tasks, task definitions, services, VPC integration, and Fargate vs. EC2 launch types.
- **Mastery Tip**: Compare Fargate vs. Lambda vs. EC2 for compute scenarios.
