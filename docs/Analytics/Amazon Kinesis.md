### **1. Kinesis Core Concepts**

### **Kinesis Services**

- **Kinesis Data Streams**:
    - Real-time data ingestion and storage (default 24 hours, up to 365 days).
    - Uses **shards** to scale throughput (1 MB/s write, 2 MB/s read per shard).
    - Consumers (e.g., Lambda, EC2) process data via APIs or KCL (Kinesis Client Library).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., ingest clickstream data for real-time dashboards.
- **Kinesis Data Firehose**:
    - Delivers streaming data to destinations (S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, Splunk).
    - Supports transformations via Lambda and format conversion (e.g., JSON to Parquet).
    - Buffers data for cost-efficient delivery (size/time-based).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., load logs to S3 with Lambda transformation.
- **Kinesis Data Analytics**:
    - Analyzes streaming data using SQL or Apache Flink.
    - Outputs results to S3, Redshift, or other streams.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., compute average click rate every 10 seconds.
- **Kinesis Video Streams**:
    - Ingests, stores, and processes video streams (e.g., from cameras).
    - Supports playback and integration with Rekognition for analytics.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., analyze surveillance video for motion detection.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Shards** (Data Streams):
    - Unit of throughput (1 MB/s write, 1,000 records/s, 2 MB/s read).
    - Data partitioned across shards using partition keys.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., 10 shards handle 10 MB/s write.
- **Records**:
    - Data unit in streams (data blob + partition key + sequence number).
    - Max 1 MB per record.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., JSON log entry as a record.
- **Consumers**:
    - Applications reading from streams (e.g., Lambda, KCL, SDK).
    - **Standard Consumer**: Polls shards (up to 2 MB/s).
    - **Enhanced Fan-Out**: Pushes data to consumers (faster, dedicated throughput).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Lambda consumer processes clickstream.
- **Partition Key**:
    - Determines shard assignment for records.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., use user_id to distribute records.
- **Retention Period** (Data Streams):
    - Default 24 hours; extendable to 7 days or 365 days (long-term retention).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., retain logs for 7 days for auditing.
- **Buffering** (Firehose):
    - Buffers data by size (1–128 MB) or time (60–900 seconds) before delivery.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., buffer 5 MB or 300 seconds to S3.
- **Kinesis Client Library (KCL)**:
    - Simplifies building scalable consumer applications.
    - Manages shard distribution and checkpointing.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., KCL app processes 100 shards.

### **Key Notes**:
