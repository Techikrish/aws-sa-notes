### **1. Athena Core Concepts**

### **Components**

- **Query Engine**:
    - Based on Presto with extensions for AWS-specific integrations.
    - Executes SQL queries against data in S3 or federated sources.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., query CloudTrail logs in S3 using SELECT * FROM cloudtrail_logs.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**:
    - Metadata repository for databases, tables, and schemas.
    - Defines structure of data in S3 (e.g., columns, partitions).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Glue table defines cloudtrail_logs schema.
- **Workgroups**:
    - Logical groupings for queries, users, and settings (e.g., query limits, encryption).
    - Controls access, cost tracking, and query execution settings.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., workgroup for “Analysts” with S3 output encryption.
- **Federated Queries**:
    - Queries data from non-S3 sources (e.g., RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB) via connectors.
    - Uses Lambda-based connectors for external data sources.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., query RDS MySQL table alongside S3 data.
- **Query Results**:
    - Stored in S3 (user-specified bucket) as CSV or other formats.
    - Cached for 24 hours to reduce repeat query costs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., query results saved to s3://athena-results/.
- **Prepared Statements**:
    - Parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection and improve reusability.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., PREPARE stmt FROM SELECT * FROM logs WHERE date = ?.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**:
    - Custom logic in SQL queries using Lambda or Java-based functions.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., UDF to parse complex JSON logs.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Data Formats**:
    - Optimized formats (Parquet, ORC) reduce query costs and improve performance.
    - Supports compressed formats (e.g., GZIP, Snappy).
    - **Explanation**: E.g., Parquet reduces data scanned for queries.
- **Partitioning**:
    - Organizes S3 data into partitions (e.g., year=2025/month=04) to reduce scanned data.
    - Defined in Glue Data Catalog or manually.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., partition by date to scan only 2025/04 data.
- **Encryption**:
    - Queries and results encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (S3 SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or CSE-KMS).
    - Workgroup-level encryption settings.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., KMS-encrypted query results in S3.
- **Access Control**:
    - IAM policies control access to Athena, Glue, and S3.
    - Lake Formation provides fine-grained row/column-level access.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., IAM policy allows athena:StartQueryExecution.
- **Query Cost**:
    - Billed per TB of data scanned ($5/TB, rounded to 10 MB).
    - Caching and compression reduce costs.
    - **Explanation**: E.g., query scanning 1 GB costs $0.005.

### **Key Notes**:

- **Exam Relevance**: Understand querying S3, Glue integration, partitioning, federation, and cost optimization.
